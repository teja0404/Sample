Home work

Rainy Season: (Check scores obtained for different queries like uing script score and try to sort them)


we are very good at finding the queries but sorting them in order matters!!!!

we are using rating to produce custom score and again we are sorting them using rating????(sort using _score)

Are we using (version_5) to give more preference to collections ??? and again we will loose our order if we sort according 
 rating ;(

Health and daily life

I have no clue why this images are popping up(Chiranjeevi and soundarya)

Match phrase!!!!???

Health and daily life(we have a collection pf images on Health and hygiene)

Work from home
we are failing in showing the order of the images!!!! 


Exact Matching : Work from home ,Home work

we need to change the "SORT"

Family spending time: We have exact query match

Cross Fiels should be used when parts of the query may present in 
different fields (sub parts in a query like Name contains (first name and second name)Teja illa and we have fields like first name )

Best query and match fields

why we should use best fields than cross fields 

lets take example of Brown fox: we are looking for brown fox in a single field like(title or tags but not in different ones)

         But what happens with cross fields is its basic intention is single query should match in different fileds
          
          like name of person: Teja illa (Here teja will present in the field of first name and illa in second name)
          one of the solution is joining both the fields into full name=First name+second name (But for that we need to change indexing)
          so in that case cross fileds will be used in Quering time.


here we were using both but we need to change the order (the second one is nothing but best fileds but best fields should be )

Basic structure of both:
      
         query:Brown Fox
   
         match_phrase:

         Best fields:
                 (+Title:Brown +Title:Fox) | (+Tags:Brown +Tags:Fox)
       
         Cross fields:
                  (+Title:Brown +Tags:Brown) | (+Title:Fox +Tags:Fox)

Add the data!!!

Try field centric and next term centric and look for the results!!!

determining an identity of an unknown Internet-of-Things (IoT) device in a communication network

receiving network traffic generated by the unknown IoT device

extracting device network behavior from the generated network traffic

determining the identity of the unknown IoT device from a list of known IoT devices by applying a selected machine learning based classifier



network traffic ----> device network behaviour ----> Apply ML algorithm ----


Clami 1:   
 
         receiving network traffic generated by the unknown IoT device
         extracting device network behavior 
        
        from the generated network traffic; and determining the identity of the unknown IoT device from a list of known IoT devices by applying a 
        selected machine learning based classifier from a set of machine learning based classifiers to analyze the device network behaviour, 

        each machine learning based classifier of the set is trained by a dataset including a plurality of features representing network behaviour of a 
        respective known IoT device from the list and the known IoT device's identity;
      
        wherein the plurality of features being associated with the corresponding device network behaviour of the generated network traffic.


claim 2:
  
      network traffic includes a number of communication sessions having respective 
      unlabeled feature vectors representing the device network behaviour of the unknown IoT device 

     
      wherein each machine learning based classifier of the set includes a single session classifier associated with a respective 
      known IoT device in the list and for outputting a probability; 

      a classification threshold for comparing with the probability to determine 
      if the session being analyzed is generated by a particular device in the known IoT device list; 
      and a session sequence size defining the number of communication sessions to analyze.
